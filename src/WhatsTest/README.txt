WhatsTest will often requiere your IMEI, phone number, and nickname to work.
These variables are now provided through the app.config file. The app.config 
file itself should never be under version control, to prevent accidental
commits to the public repositories with your public data. 

A sample app.config file is provided (app.config.sample).

That file should be copied and given the name "app.config". 
Imei, phone and nickname settings should now be changed on it.
